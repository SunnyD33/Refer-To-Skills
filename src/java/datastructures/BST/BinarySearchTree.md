# Binary Search Tree (BST) [Java]
Data Structure

- A BST contains nodes and 2 pointers for each node

## Components of a BST
- Root: The root of a tree is the top most node of a tree
- Edge: Edge acts as a link between the parent node and the child node
- Leaf: A node that has no children
- Depth: The depth of a node is the distance from the root to the particular node that was passed from the BST
- Height: The height of the node is the distance from that node to the deepest node of the tree
- Height of the BST: The height of the tree is the maximum height of any node.
